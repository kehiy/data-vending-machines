title: Nostr Event Publish Schedule
description: Schedule nostr events for future publishing
---

Schedule events to be published in the future. (Job requests can be encrypted per NIP-90.)
Events to be published can have a different pubkey than the requester's pubkey (i.e. an event can be scheduled to be published by a different user than the user who scheduling it).

# Input

Event(s) to be scheduled

```js
[ "i", "<stringified-event-json>", "text" ]
```

# Params

* `relays` - array of relays to publish to (optional)

# Output

Event ID that was published.

# Feedback

Job feedback is sent back the moment an event is scheduled.

```js
{
    "content": nip04_encrypt("

    "tags": [
        [ "e", "<5905-event-job-request>" ],
        [ "p", "<pubkey-a>" ],
        [ "encrypted" ]
    ]
